We're hosting this on the Coventry University Campus, which is a 15 minutes walk
away from the train station or 10 minutes from the Coach station.

Please account for the chance of event overruns when buying tickets, hackathons
are notorious for overrunning.

### <i class="fas fa-train"></i> Train

Coventry has direct train links to the following major cities:

* Birmingham (20 minute Journey from New Street Station)
* London (1 Hour from Euston with fast train, 2 hours with the cheaper and slower one)
* Oxford (45 Minutes)
* Manchester (2 Hours from Manchester Piccadilly)

If you are coming from the East Midlands (Cambridge, Leicester, etc), you can get the Cross Country train from Stansted to Birmingham and get off at Nuneaton. From Nuneaton it's a 20 minute journey here.

### <i class="fas fa-bus"></i> Bus

Coventry has direct coach links to Birmingham and London, with both of those
having cities being reachable by most destinations.

If coming from further away, it would be a reasonable option to take an overnight
trip to one of those cities and then take the train into Coventry.
