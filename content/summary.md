# Welcome to CovHack 2019!

CovHack 2019 is a student hackathon organised by the Hackathon Society at
Coventry University. Students from Coventry and beyond of all skill levels can
come and build weird, wacky and wonderful projects.

We'll have workshops and side events during the event, including some computer
security challenges for when you want a break from your project!
