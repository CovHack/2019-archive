# Welcome to CovHack 2019!
## CovHack 2019 is a student hackathon organised by the Hackathon Society at Coventry University.

**Students from Coventry and beyond of all skill levels are invited to come and build weird, wacky and wonderful projects.**

**We will have workshops and side events during the event, including some computer security challenges for when you want a break from your project!**
