      <description>Find Us We&amp;rsquo;re hosting this on the Coventry University Campus, which is a 15 minutes walk away from the train station or 10 minutes from the Coach station.
Please account for the chance of event overruns when buying tickets, hackathons are notorious for overrunning.
Train Coventry has direct train links to the following major cities:
 Birmingham (20 minute Journey from New Street Station) London (1 Hour from Euston with fast train, 2 hours with the cheaper and slower one) Oxford (45 Minutes) Manchester (2 Hours from Manchester Piccadilly)  If you are coming from the East Midlands (Cambridge, Leicester, etc), you can get the Cross Country train from Stansted to Birmingham and get off at Nuneaton.</description>
